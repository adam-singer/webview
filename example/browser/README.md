# Browser

This is a port to dart of the Chrome Apps' [browser][] sample.

This example tries to remain as true as possible to the original sample.  That
means that we have not used as much dart web ui goodness as is possible.  For an
example that is even more darty, have a look at the [messaging][] sample.
